Game Forge
Your project is a web-based game distribution service hosted on Google App Engine (PaaS). The application allows users to browse games, manage accounts, rate games, and leave comments.
Key Technologies:

Platform: Google App Engine (PaaS)
Backend: Python with Flask framework
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
External Libraries:

Flask (web framework)
PyMongo (MongoDB integration)
Python-dotenv (environment variables)
Werkzeug (secure file handling)
Jinja2 (templating)
Font Awesome (icons)
Google Fonts (typography)



Test Users:
You created 10 test users with varying levels of activity, with three users (Mete, Habibi, and Ertuğrul) having significant engagement across multiple games. These active users have each played multiple games, rated them, and left comments, which fulfills the project requirements.
Development Process:
You mentioned using AI assistance (ChatGPT and Claude) during development to help with various questions and challenges. The report includes many of these questions, which were typically about MongoDB integration, user management, file handling, and deployment issues.
Deployment:
The application is live at: https://gameforge1453.ey.r.appspot.com/home
Your requirements document about the "Rocket Telemetry Platform" appears to be for a different project, as it mentions using Microsoft SQL Server rather than MongoDB and focuses on rocket telemetry data rather than game distribution.
